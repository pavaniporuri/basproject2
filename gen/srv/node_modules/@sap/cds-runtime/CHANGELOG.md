  -- Handlers registered with entity = `*` aren't called by unbound events anymore.
  -- Handlers registered without entity aren't called by bound events anymore.
  -- Special case: Handlers registered in form .before/on/after(\'\*\', handler) are called by bound and unbound events.
- Expanding association from draft-enabled entity to draft enabled entities always provides active version of the expanded entity.
- If you export a function in an `init.js` file, it will be called with the primary database, and its result is awaited.
- REST: Since the service is now based on the `cds.Service` base class, all convenience functions (`create`, `post`, etc.) are streamlined.
- Messaging: Only one queue per app is created, as opposed to one queue per app and external service.
- Messaging: You can now directly connect to the (technical) messaging service through `await cds.connect.to('messaging')`, no topic names are generated here.
- Messaging: If you want to link your own or external services to messaging, you need to model your events in CDS.
- Messaging: If you want to provide custom topics for modeled events, you need to add the `@topic` annotation to the event.
- Messaging: The `prefix` option in the service's credentials is prepended to events with a `@topic` annotation.
- Messaging: The syntax to emit events with headers changed:
  ```js
  srv.emit({ event: 'yourEvent',
           data: { some: 'data' },
           headers: { some: 'headers' }})
  ```
- Messaging: The default file for `file-based-messaging` is `~/.cds-msg-box`.
- Streamlined handler registration: `srv.before/on/after(<event>, <entity>?, <handler>)`
  - Event and handler are mandatory; entity must be omitted if unbound action/function (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE are considered to be bound)
  - Event and entity may be arrayed
  - `srv.before/on/after(*, <handler>)` matches all as shorthand
- `INSERT` statements return an object or array of objects (in case of bulk) with the number of affected rows as result of `valueOf()`, as well as the keys of the inserted entities:
  ```js
  const res = await srv.run(INSERT.into('Books').entries([{ ID: 1, title: 'one' }, { ID: 2, title: 'two' }]))
  res > 1 // > true
  res.keys // > [{ ID: 1 }, { ID: 2 }]
  ```

### Added

- Custom translatable error messages

### Fixed

- Enterprise Messaging: Received messages are correctly decoded
- Reading single properties of draft enabled entities via navigations e. g. `/E0(ID=<uuid>,IsActiveEntity=false)/e1(ID=<uuid>,IsActiveEntity=false)/property`
- Not supported transformation in `groupby` throws cryptic error
- etag check only if OData request
- Statements if path expression contains keys of type `cds.Timestamp`, `cds.DateTime` or `cds.Time`

## Version 2.0.2 - 2020-06-10

### Added

- Support for XSUAA's user attribute value `$UNRESTRICTED`
- Default to combination `[...];IEEE754Compatible=true;ExponentialDecimals=true` if IEEE754Compatible or ExponentialDecimals is omitted
- Use custom authenticate middleware via `cds.env.requires.auth.impl`
- Authentication strategy `dummy` (`cds.env.requires.auth.strategy = 'dummy'`) that creates super users (i.e., pass all authorization checks)
- Support relative destination path in rest-client

### Changed

- CQN returned for `req.query` changed — for requests with path expressions, the returned CQN of `req.query` is changed to a simplified format. For `GET /Authors(150)/books` the CQN contains the path in `.from` instead of an `exists` clause in `.where`.

```
{ SELECT:  {  from: { "ref": [
        {
          "id": "AdminService.Authors",
          "where": [ { "val": 150 } ]
        },
      "books"
      ] } } }
```

- Authorizations as whitelist: if any restrictions exist for the target, all not explicitly allowed operations are forbidden (e.g., `@restrict: [{ grant: 'READ', ... }]` -> everything but `READ` is forbidden for all, including bound actions and functions)
- Applicable `@requires` and `@restrict` definitions concatenated by AND
- Reference to undefined XSUAA user attribute in `@restrict.where` results in forbidden
- `req.event` for unbound actions and functions is provided without service prefix
- Increased logging in production (temporarily until revised logging concept is implemented)
- `cds.serve(..., { passport: [...] }` -> `cds.serve(..., { auth: [...] }`

### Fixed

- `INSERT.into.as(SELECT.from...)` with `SELECT` containing placeholders
- Requests on a navigation to many with key provided returns 404 if the resource doesn't exist
- POST/PATCH requests on `Composition of many` with backlink association as key
- Path expressions on SAP HANA are now flat and not structured anymore
- `$expand` on `Composition of many` with backlink association as key
- Roles from scopes including "."
- Ignore unknown arrayed column during input validation
- Too early client release
- Pool configurations with default values can be set to `0`

### Removed

- Support for annotation `@cds.persistence.name`
- Deprecated SQL dialect `hdbcds`

## Version 2.0.1 - 2020-05-20

### Changed

- Passport strategies whitelist: `mock` and `JWT`
- Authentication not needed for calls to a service's root or metadata endpoints
- Support for "public" entities and actions (i.e., no restrictions) in services without `@requires` but other entities and/or actions with `@restrict`

### Fixed

- `target` added to assert errors

## Version 2.0.0 - 2020-05-20

### Changed

- Update major version number

## Version 1.2.0 - 2020-05-19

### Added

- The timeout of the exclusive lock of drafts can now be configured using `cds.drafts.cancellationTimeout`
- `req.params`: iterable with key-value pairs for the key predicates of the addressed resource

### Changed

- Slightly improved performance for `$expand`
- Return key values (single key only) of created entries instead of number of affected rows
- Annotations `@cds.onInsert` and `@cds.onUpdate` ignore values from the request
- Processing of read-only values moved to initial before handler
- Aligned handling of virtual, computed, read-only, immutable with java runtime
- Allow deep insert on to one association with nonkey property, the nonkey property is silently ignored

### Fixed

- Resolved some performance issues with `@sap/hana-client`
- `$filter=false or ...` is now possible
- Custom handler registration in multi-tenant scenario
- Alias in associations wasn't processed correctly in post-processing
- `$search` is now applied on the query result of `$apply` as specified in OData V4 spec
- `evictionRunIntervalMillisForPools` is now treated properly
- Searching for `_` or `%` in `$filter` queries with `contains`/`startswith`/`endswith`
- Insert of to-one associations with structured elements

## Version 1.1.1 - 2020-04-28

### Added

- Support for `orderBy` in rest-client

### Changed

- `limit` in CQN is translated to placeholders in SQL
- QL API: .where() is changed:
  -- Where with two parameters like .where('x', 1) isn't allowed and should be replaced with .where('x', '=', 1).
  -- Combinations with partial CQNs like .where({ref: ['x']}, '=', 1) aren't allowed. Use arrays of partial CQNs like .where([ {ref: ['x']}, '=', {val: 1} ]) instead.
  -- Fluent expressions work as strictly alternating string/value lists (as documented). Partial CQN can be used here as value.
- Per default, results are now ordered by keys of the entity

### Fixed

- `$filter=false or ...` is now possible
- CREATE now returns `context.data` if not all non-UUID keys are provided
  and no error is thrown in the database client
- CANCEL and PATCH drafts now support multiple fields in where clauses
- Handler registration for draft events in multitenancy scenario
- Localize expanded entities
- Composition and Association to one with expand in draft case
- Disable local default pagination via `@cds.query.limit.default: 0`
- Brackets in object predicates in where

## Version 1.1.0 - 2020-04-23

### Added

- Support for CREATE operations with delegated key generation
- `@cds.persistence.skip` annotated entities return HTTP code 501 in generic handlers
- Introduced `@cds.localized:false` on entity-level for switching off automatic redirection to localized views
- Server-side pagination on global, service, and entity-level via `@cds.query.limit`
- Omitted key predicates of nested composition items are augmented, if possible
- The exclusive lock of a draft automatically times out after 15 minutes
- Static where annotations for RUD
- Associations to one annotated with `@assert.integrity: false` are ignored on integrity checks
- Support input validation annotations in ODATA

### Changed

- Object notation in `.where` of statements doesn't allow functions anymore
- `context.diff()` ignores `@cds.persistence.skip` annotated entities
- Always try to read from localized views (also by draft enabled entities)
- In multitenant scenario, the CSN model is now always loaded from `@sap/cds-mtx`. Previously, it was only loaded if it was extended.
- Use open source version of `@sap-cloud-sdk/core`
- If a column or column alias is used multiple times in a SELECT query, the query is from now on rejected. Example: `SELECT.from(Foo).columns(['c1', 'c1'])`

### Fixed

- Reference integrity checks for foreign entities without stored keys
- Calculation of `HasActiveEntity`
- Update and Delete with where annotations
- Aliases by navigation with complex where annotation
- `req._.res` is express' ServerResponse
- SQL Error in case of `$filter` using `ne` operator in combination with `$search`
- Deep update with immutable fields in child entities
- Draft union scenario in case of DraftAdministrativeData navigation
- Transaction handling inside `$batch` requests
- Multiple aliases in `SELECT.columns`
- Use `hdb` if in direct dependencies of app (and `@sap/hana-client` isn't)
- Mapping over a result propagates `$count`
- Don't ignore rows with `null` column values in negated `$search` queries
